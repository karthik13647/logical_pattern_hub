## 🎯 Interview Tips

### **Common Pattern Types in Interviews:**
1. **Star Patterns** - Most fundamental, test basic loop understanding
2. **Number Patterns** - Test arithmetic and sequence logic
3. **Character Patterns** - Test ASCII manipulation and alphabet sequences
4. **Mixed Patterns** - Combine multiple concepts

### **Key Problem-Solving Steps:**
1. **Analyze the Pattern:** Identify rows, columns, and relationships
2. **Find the Logic:** Determine mathematical relationships between position and output
3. **Write Pseudo-code:** Plan your loops and conditions
4. **Optimize:** Look for ways to reduce complexity or improve readability
5. **Test Edge Cases:** Consider n=1, n=0, and large values

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not handling edge cases (n=0, n=1)
- Incorrect spacing calculations
- Off-by-one errors in loop conditions
- Not considering time complexity for large inputs
