# Opposite Pyramid Star Pattern

## Medium

---

**Problem:** Create a program that prints an opposite pyramid pattern of stars with spaces between each star, based on user input for the number of rows.

**Description:** Given an integer `n` representing the number of rows for each half, print an opposite pyramid pattern where each star is followed by a space. The pattern consists of two parts: an upper inverted triangle that shrinks from (2n) stars to 2 stars, followed by a lower triangle that grows from 2 stars back to (2n) stars, creating two pyramids pointing towards each other.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: enter the rows: 3
Output:
  * * * * * 
    * * * 
      * 
      * 
    * * * 
  * * * * * 
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: enter the rows: 4
Output:
  * * * * * * * 
    * * * * * 
      * * * 
        * 
        * 
      * * * 
    * * * * * 
  * * * * * * * 
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: enter the rows: 5
Output:
  * * * * * * * * * 
    * * * * * * * 
      * * * * * 
        * * * 
          *  
          * 
        * * * 
      * * * * * 
    * * * * * * * 
  * * * * * * * * * 
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- Program should handle positive integers only

### Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
### Space Complexity: O(1)

### Pattern Analysis:
**Upper Triangle (n-1 rows):**
- Row 1: (n-1) double spaces + 1 star
- Row 2: (n-2) double spaces + 3 stars
- ...
- Row (n-1): 1 double space + (2n-3) stars

**Lower Triangle (n rows):**
- Row 1: 1 double space + (2n-1) stars
- Row 2: 2 double spaces + (2n-3) stars
- ...
- Row n: n double spaces + 1 star
